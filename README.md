A framework I hacked together over an evening or two to have a starting point for apps runnable
under both Windows and in a web browser which can do ES3.1 & WebAssembly.

This project has the following dependencies:
* Dear ImgUI (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
* GLAD-generated ES3.1 support (autogenerated by https://github.com/Dav1dde/glad)
* GLFW (https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
* Khronos headers for ES 3.1
